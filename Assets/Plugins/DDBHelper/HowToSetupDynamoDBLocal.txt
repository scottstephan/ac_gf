These will be pretty basic, high level steps.

Here is some reference from the official site
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tools.DynamoDBLocal.html

Prerequisites
- Java JRE 6+ installed
-- Either search google for "JRE" or get it here:
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html
-- Install it

1. Make sure JRE is installed
2. Download DynamoDBLocal from http://dynamodb-local.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dynamodb_local_latest
3. Extract .tar.gz file into its own folder.  If you can't extract that type of file, get 7zip, it supports 
   these file types even on windows:  http://www.7-zip.org/
4. Open command prompt / shell
5. Navigate to folder where you just extracted everything
6. In commmand prompt, use:  java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -port 8000
   java is the 'command' you're using that is the JRE requirement from above
   you're giving it a path which is a subdirectory in the location you unpacked everything
   -jar is the 'jar file' location, again, same directory.  a .jar file is just a java-specific zip file, more or less
   -port is designating the port to use
7. Some gobblygook appeared.  Don't close the window else you'll close the local DynamoDB.
8. In the DBUnityHelper, you can select the port and whether to use DynamoDBLocal

Using DynamoDB Local doesn't care about your Secret Key, so you can make it whatever you like.  It's just a local flat
file database but is very fast and useful for testing some things; however, the lack of graphical view of objects makes
it quite difficult at times.  Best for some local testing, or when a firewall is blocking your access to the remote system
